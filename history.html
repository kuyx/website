        <h2>University of Cebu's History</h2>
        <p>It was a beginning marked by simplicity. By modesty. A period stamped with nothing but desire and hope: the desire to provide ordinary young men and women with good but not a costly education and the hope that doing so may improve the quality of their lives. May mean the realization of their dreams.
            This was the Cebu College of Commerce: with an opening enrolment of 239 in the first semester, 232 in the second semester, and, 69 in the summer.
            This was the CCC of old: offering a Bachelor of Science in Commerce and an Associate in Secretarial Science in its initial year.</p>



        <p>Those were the days: the period of knocking on doors to inquire whether a young person was interested in going to a school, near where? Behind Victor Theater? At the back of Snow Sheen? The time of scrounging for chalk and eraser for teachers so that the students would read at least a little something on the board. The moment of barely meeting salaries for employees payday after payday.
            Slowly but surely, however, CCC grew. Because Atty. Augusto W. Go and companions built it, people came - students came. The 239 became 380, then 531, and on the 8th school year as the Cebu College of Commerce, 4185. Consequently, more courses opened: Education, Liberal Arts, Criminology, Customs.</p>

        
        <p>Spanning, indeed, 8 full school years from School Year 1964-65 up to School Year 1971-72, CCC has began to make itself felt in the City of Cebu, in Region VII, and in the lives of many poor families whose fortunes have changed by the CCC education their children received.
            The growth was simply inspiring: from an initial offering of Commerce and Secretarial, CCC began to offer diplomas in Education, Liberal Arts, Customs Administration, Criminology, Nautical; and, from an initial 239 population, CCC reached the 4, 000 mark on its 8th year.</p>
