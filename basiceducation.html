        <p>High School Department
          The High School Department is one of the pioneering departments of the Cebu College of Commerce now called University of Cebu. It opened on July 1964 and offered day and night classes until academic year 2001 – 2002. It was housed in an old candy factory building which was turned into classrooms. With almost 400 high school students and less than 20 faculty members, the school acquired in 1968 VS Villamor Colleges building to accommodate the increasing number of enrollees. A couple of years after, it was transferred to a 3-storey wooden building, the first ever structure constructed by UC.</p><br>
          <p>Its first High School Principal was the late Mrs. Visitacion Estorco. In 1993, computer courses were offered to high school students in order to cope with the global demands in information technology. After the fire hit the high school building in 2001, a 7-storey building was constructed. This is where the department is being housed since June 2003.<br>
            <br>Coherent with its mission, the UC High School Department aims to:</p>
            <li>provide learners with academic, scientific, entrepreneurial skills and attitudes necessary for the demands of time;</li>
            <li>develop holistic individuals;</li>
            <li>deepen the learners awareness and willingness to be pro-active in the service of the community through environmental stewardship;</li>
            <li>produce competent graduates ready for higher education or gainful employment.</li>
      </div>
      <div class="depart">
        <p>The department offers first year (now Grade 7 – following the K to 12 curriculum) with enhanced schedule in Science, Social Studies and Technology and Home Economics (TLE) following a whole day schedule. The second to fourth year levels are still following the old curriculum with two sessions (morning and afternoon).<br>

          <br>To facilitate our students’ learning, the High School Department has Audio Visual Room, Speech Laboratory, Learning Laboratory , Computer Laboratories & Science Laboratories for each year level. Its curriculum is enhanced with Understanding by Design (UBD), Project Based Learning (PBL) in order to attain Educational Excellence and to produce success-oriented individuals.</p>
